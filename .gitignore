# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Ignore file created by RSpec in order to support `--only-failures` and `--next-failure` CLI options.
/spec/examples.txt

# Ignore machine specific environment configuration
/.env

# Ignore SimpleCov results
/coverage
